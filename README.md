# 🛡️ AegisStore

### Risk-Adaptive AI-Powered Intelligent Storage Optimizer for Linux

> **AegisStore doesn't just find files to clean — it understands usage, predicts future value, evaluates risk, considers live system load, explains its decisions, and keeps the user in control.**

AegisStore is an AI-powered storage intelligence and optimization system designed for Linux/Ubuntu. It analyzes filesystem behavior, identifies redundant and low-value files, predicts future file usage, forecasts storage growth, and generates explainable cleanup and archiving recommendations.

Unlike traditional storage cleaners that primarily rely on file size or age, AegisStore combines **usage intelligence, machine learning, dependency awareness, risk assessment, and live system telemetry** to make safer and more meaningful recommendations.

# 🎯 Problem Statement

Modern Linux systems accumulate large amounts of data over time:

- Unused files
- Duplicate files
- Old project artifacts
- Temporary files
- Logs and caches
- Large files with little future value
- Files that may still be required by applications or system components

Traditional cleanup tools generally use simple rules such as:

```text
Large file + old file = delete
````

This can be unsafe because **age and size alone do not determine whether a file is valuable or safe to remove**.

AegisStore addresses this problem by asking:

> **"What is this file doing, how likely is it to be useful again, how much storage does it consume, and is it safe to optimize right now?"**

---

# 💡 Solution

AegisStore creates an intelligent storage decision pipeline:

# ✨ Key Features

## 1. 🔍 Intelligent Filesystem Scanning

AegisStore scans a controlled filesystem location and collects information such as:

* File path
* File size
* Access time
* Modification time
* SHA-256 hash
* File classification
* Usage characteristics

The scanner also avoids unnecessary directories such as:

```text
.git
node_modules
__pycache__
.venv
```

---

# 2. 📊 Usage Intelligence

AegisStore analyzes how files are being used rather than relying only on their age.

Files can be classified into:

| Profile    | Meaning                     |
| ---------- | --------------------------- |
| 🔥 HOT     | Frequently or recently used |
| 🟡 WARM    | Moderately used             |
| ❄️ COLD    | Rarely used                 |
| ⚫ INACTIVE | Little or no observed usage |

Usage features include:

* Access frequency
* Recent access ratio
* Days since last access
* Modification age
* Historical usage

---

# 3. 🤖 Future Usage Prediction

AegisStore uses a machine-learning model to estimate whether a file is likely to be accessed again.

### Model

**Random Forest Classifier**

The model considers features including:

```text
access_count_7d
access_count_30d
access_count_90d
total_access_count
days_since_last_access
recent_access_ratio
size_bytes
days_since_modified
```

The model produces a:

```text
Future Usage Probability
```

which is used as an advisory signal for recommendations.

### Prototype Evaluation

The controlled synthetic evaluation achieved approximately:

| Metric    |  Score |
| --------- | -----: |
| Accuracy  | 93.33% |
| Precision | 96.53% |
| Recall    | 93.73% |
| F1 Score  | 95.11% |
| ROC-AUC   | 98.45% |

> ⚠️ These are **controlled synthetic/prototype results**, not production performance on a real Ubuntu population.

---

# 4. ♻️ Duplicate Detection

AegisStore calculates SHA-256 hashes to identify duplicate files.

Example:

```text
file_A.zip ─────┐
file_B.zip ─────┼──► Same SHA-256 → Duplicate
file_C.zip ─────┘
```

Duplicate files can significantly increase storage usage without providing additional value.

---

# 5. 🧠 Explainable Recommendations

AegisStore does not simply output:

```text
DELETE file
```

Instead, it provides recommendations such as:

```text
KEEP
CLEANUP
ARCHIVE
REVIEW
```

Each recommendation contains an explanation based on signals such as:

* Future usage probability
* File age
* File size
* Duplicate status
* Usage profile
* Reproducibility
* Safety context

---

# 6. 🛡️ Risk-Adaptive Decision Engine

AegisStore introduces a risk layer between recommendation and optimization.

Each candidate receives a:

```text
Risk Score: 0 – 100
```

and a corresponding risk tier:

```text
LOW
MEDIUM
HIGH
```

The decision engine can produce actions such as:

```text
AUTOMATE
SCHEDULE
APPROVAL_REQUIRED
DEFER
SKIP
```

This prevents the system from treating every cleanup candidate equally.

---

# 7. 🔒 Dependency-Aware Safety

Before optimization is considered, AegisStore checks whether a file may be important to the system.

Safety signals include:

* Active/open file
* Package-manager ownership
* Git tracking
* Symbolic link
* Symlink target
* systemd references
* cron references

For example:

```text
Package-owned file
       │
       ▼
    REVIEW
       │
       X
 No automatic optimization
```

This makes the system **recommendation-first rather than deletion-first**.

---

# 8. ⚡ Live System Load Awareness

AegisStore monitors the current system state using:

* CPU utilization
* RAM utilization
* I/O wait
* Disk read activity
* Disk write activity

System state is categorized as:

```text
NORMAL
BUSY
CRITICAL
```

If the system is busy, optimization can be deferred.

Example:

```text
CPU: 81%
I/O Wait: 14%

       ↓

System Busy

       ↓

DEFER optimization
```

This allows AegisStore to consider not only **what action to take**, but also **when it is safe to take it**.

---

# 9. 🕐 Energy / Performance-Aware Scheduling

AegisStore records scheduling decisions such as:

```text
DEFERRED
RETRIED
EXECUTED
```

The dashboard can display a timeline such as:

```text
14:02:11
DEFERRED
CPU 81% | RAM 74% | I/O Wait 14%

        ↓

02:00:04
EXECUTED
CPU 9% | System load within safe limits
```

This demonstrates that optimization can be aligned with system workload instead of blindly running at any time.

> AegisStore does not require a background daemon or uncontrolled autonomous scheduler.

---

# 10. 🔄 Counterfactual Explanations

AegisStore can answer:

> **"What would have changed the decision?"**

For example:

```text
Current Risk: 72
Action: REVIEW

If the file were 7 days newer:

Risk: 62
Action: SCHEDULE
```

This makes the decision engine more transparent and easier to understand.

Counterfactual explanations are generated by re-evaluating the existing decision engine with controlled input changes.

---

# 11. 📈 Storage Forecasting

AegisStore analyzes historical storage usage to estimate future storage requirements.

The forecasting module provides:

* Current storage utilization
* Growth rate
* Estimated time to storage thresholds
* Forecast horizon
* Sample count
* Forecast quality

Example:

```text
Current Usage       : 72%
Estimated Growth    : 1.8 GB/day

85% threshold       : ~7 days
90% threshold       : ~10 days
95% threshold       : ~13 days
```

---

# 12. 🧹 Cleanup Recommendations

AegisStore identifies files that may be suitable for cleanup based on multiple signals.

Example:

```text
Duplicate
+
Low future-use probability
+
Large storage impact
+
No safety flags

        ↓

CLEANUP
```

The system does **not blindly delete files**.

---

# 13. 📦 Archive Recommendations

Some files may have low near-term usage but still have long-term value.

Instead of deleting them, AegisStore can recommend:

```text
ARCHIVE
```

This is particularly useful for:

* Old project artifacts
* Historical datasets
* Large logs
* Rarely accessed files
* Backup-like data

---

# 14. 🗑️ Reversible Quarantine

AegisStore uses a controlled quarantine workflow for supported file operations.

Instead of immediately destroying data:

```text
Original File
     │
     ▼
Quarantine
     │
     ▼
Audit Log
```

The operation can be tracked through the application's audit system.

The design philosophy is:

> **Recommend first. Execute carefully. Keep the user in control.**

---

# 15. 🧾 Audit Logging

AegisStore maintains an audit trail of important actions and decisions.

Examples include:

```text
CLEANUP
ARCHIVE
DEFERRED
RETRIED
QUARANTINE
```

Each event can contain information such as:

* Timestamp
* File path
* Action
* Reason
* System load
* Quarantine location
* Reversibility

This improves transparency and accountability.

---

# 16. 🛡️ Threat Model & Safety Guarantees

AegisStore follows several safety principles:

### No uncontrolled deletion

The system does not automatically delete arbitrary files.

### Open files are protected

Files currently used by active processes are treated as unsafe optimization candidates.

### Dependency awareness

Package-owned, Git-tracked, symlink-related, systemd-referenced, and cron-referenced files can be flagged.

### Risk-based gating

Recommendations are evaluated using risk and safety signals.

### Load-aware deferral

Optimization can be postponed when system resources are under heavy load.

### Human-in-the-loop

The final decision remains with the user.

---

# 🔐 Safety Design

AegisStore is intentionally designed as a **recommendation-first system**.

It is **not** intended to function as an unrestricted filesystem deletion tool.

The architecture prioritizes:

```text
Analyze
   ↓
Predict
   ↓
Explain
   ↓
Assess Risk
   ↓
Check Safety
   ↓
Recommend
   ↓
User Decision
   ↓
Controlled Action
```

---

# 🎯 Design Philosophy

AegisStore follows five core principles:

### 1. Intelligence

Understand file behavior rather than relying only on age and size.

### 2. Safety

Never assume that an old file is safe to remove.

### 3. Explainability

Every important recommendation should have a reason.

### 4. Adaptability

System load and environmental conditions should influence optimization timing.

### 5. Human Control

The system recommends; the user decides.

---

# 📊 What Makes AegisStore Different?

Traditional storage tools often answer:

> **"Where is my storage being used?"**

AegisStore aims to answer:

> **"What is using my storage, how valuable is it likely to be in the future, what should I do about it, why, and is now a safe time to act?"**

### Comparison

# 🏆 Project Highlights

AegisStore combines several layers into a single storage intelligence pipeline:

```text
Filesystem Intelligence
        +
Usage Analytics
        +
Machine Learning
        +
Duplicate Detection
        +
Storage Forecasting
        +
Risk Assessment
        +
Dependency Awareness
        +
Live System Telemetry
        +
Scheduling
        +
Explainability
        +
Auditability
```

This combination transforms storage cleanup from a simple rule-based task into a **risk-aware decision-support system**.

---

# 17. 🎓 Feedback-Driven Recalibration

Every recommendation shown in the dashboard has 👍 Accept / 👎 Reject buttons.
Each click is logged with the file's risk score and future-usage probability.

Once at least 6 feedback samples exist (with at least one accept and one
reject), clicking **"Recalibrate now"** fits a logistic regression mapping
risk score to acceptance probability, and derives new LOW/HIGH risk-tier
boundaries from where that curve crosses 0.5 and 0.15.

This is a genuine learning loop, not a cosmetic reset: the new boundary is
written to `calibration.json`, and `decision_engine.py` reads it on every
future scoring call — so the *same file with the same risk score* can land
in a different risk tier after recalibration, because the boundary itself
moved based on what users actually accepted or rejected.

```text
20 feedback samples (10 accepted low-risk cleanups, 10 rejected high-risk ones)
        │
        ▼
Logistic regression fit: risk_score -> P(accept)
        │
        ▼
LOW threshold:  31   -> 47.5
HIGH threshold: 66   -> 57.5
```

Reset to defaults anytime with the **"Reset calibration to defaults"** button,
or `python3 recalibrate.py --reset`.

---

# 18. 📜 Digital Archaeology Summary Mode

Instead of a flat file list, AegisStore groups scan results into short,
plain-English stories a non-technical reader can act on immediately:

```text
"40.0 MB of inactive data in backups/, untouched for 140+ days"
"27.0 MB of inactive data in build/, untouched for 187+ days"
"40.0 MB across 1 duplicate file in datasets/"
```

Groups are formed from data the scan already computed (usage profile +
duplicate status + parent directory) — no additional filesystem access is
performed to build these summaries.

---

# ⚠️ Limitations

AegisStore is a project/prototype and has intentionally defined boundaries.

### Usage history

File usage history is based on events recorded by AegisStore rather than automatically monitoring every filesystem access on the system.

### ML training

The current model evaluation uses controlled/synthetic data and should not be interpreted as production-grade performance.

### Scheduling

The project demonstrates energy/performance-aware scheduling logic but does not implement an unrestricted background daemon.

### Filesystem scope

Scanning should be performed on controlled directories rather than blindly targeting the entire operating system.

### Recommendations

AegisStore provides recommendations and safety analysis; it does not guarantee that every recommendation is correct.

---

# 🔮 Future Scope

Potential future improvements include:

* Real filesystem event monitoring using `inotify`
* Larger real-world usage datasets
* More advanced time-series forecasting
* Personalized storage behavior models
* Cloud/object-storage integration
* Intelligent compression recommendations
